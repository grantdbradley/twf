<H2> This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 301) </H2>
<H4> John Baez </H4>
<!-- END HEADER -->

The first 300 issues of This Week's Finds were devoted to the beauty
of math and physics. Now I want to bite off a bigger chunk of reality.
I want to talk about all sorts of things, but especially <em>how
scientists can help save the planet</em>.  I'll start by interviewing
some scientists with different views on the challenges we face &mdash;
including some who started out in other fields, because I'm trying to
make that transition myself.

<p>
By the way: I know "save the planet" sounds pompous.  As George Carlin
joked: "Save the planet?  There's nothing wrong with the planet.  The
planet is fine.  The <em>people</em> are screwed."  (He actually put
it a bit more <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eScDfYzMEEw&amp;feature=player_embedded">colorfully</a>.)

<p>
But I believe it's more accurate when he says:

<p>
<blockquote>
I think, to be fair, the planet probably sees us as a mild
threat. Something to be dealt with. And I am sure the planet will
defend itself in the manner of a large organism, like a beehive or an
ant colony, and muster a defense.  </blockquote>

<p>
I think we're annoying the biosphere.  I'd like us to become less
annoying, both for its sake and our own.  I actually considered using
the slogan <i>how scientists can help humans be less annoying</i>
&mdash; but my advertising agency ran a focus group, and they picked
<i>how scientists can help save the planet</i>.

<p>
Besides interviewing people, I want to talk about where we stand on
various issues, and what scientists can do.  It's a very large task,
so I'm really hoping lots of you reading this will help out.  You can
explain stuff, correct mistakes, and point me to good sources of
information.  With a lot of help from Andrew Stacey, I'm starting a
wiki where we can collect these pointers.  I'm hoping it will grow
into something interesting.

<p>
But today I'll start with a brief overview, just to get things rolling.  

<p>
In case you haven't noticed: we're heading for trouble in a number of
ways. Our last two centuries were dominated by rapid technology change
and a rapidly soaring population:

<p>
<div align="center">
<img width="450" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/population-graph.jpg" />
</div>

<p>
The population is <a
href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpopgraph.php">still
climbing fast</a>, though the percentage increase per year is <a
href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldgrgraph.php">dropping</a>.
Energy consumption per capita is also rising.  So, from 1980 to 2007
the world-wide usage of power <a
href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=44&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=&amp;syid=1980&amp;eyid=2007&amp;unit=QBTU">soared
from 10 to 16 terawatts</a>.

<p>
96% of this power now comes from fossil fuels. So, we're putting huge
amounts of carbon dioxide into the air: <a
href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8">30
billion metric tons in 2007</a>.  So, the carbon dioxide concentration
of the atmosphere is rising at a rapid clip: from about 290 parts per
million before the industrial revolution, to about 370 in the year
2000, to about 390 now:

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mauna_Loa_Carbon_Dioxide-en.svg">
<img border = "none" width="450"
src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Mauna_Loa_Carbon_Dioxide.png"
/>
</a></div>

<br />&nbsp;<br /> 

<p>
As you'd expect, temperatures are rising:

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/">
<img border = "none" width="450" src="temperature/temperature_1880-2010_GISS.jpg" />
</a></div>

<p>
<br />&nbsp;<br /> 

But how much will they go up?  The ultimate amount of warming will largely depend on the total amount of carbon dioxide we put into the air. The research branch of the National Academy of Sciences recently put out a report on these issues:

<p>
<ul><li> National Research Council, <a
href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12877"><i>Climate
Stabilization Targets: Emissions, Concentrations, and Impacts over
Decades to Millennia</i></a>, 2010.
</ul>

<p>
Here are their estimates:

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&amp;page=3">
<img border = "none" width="350" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diary/CO2_temperature_relation.jpg" />
</a></div>

<br />&nbsp;<br /> 

You'll note there's lots of uncertainty, but a rough rule of thumb is
that each doubling of carbon dioxide will raise the temperature around
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity">3 degrees
Celsius</a>.  Of course people love to argue about these things: you
can find reasonable people who'll give a number anywhere between 1.5
and 4.5 &deg;C, and unreasonable people who say practically anything.
We'll get into this later, I'm sure.

<p>
But anyway: if we keep up "business as usual", it's easy to imagine us
doubling the carbon dioxide sometime this century, so we need to ask:
what would a world 3 &deg;C warmer be like?

<p>
It doesn't sound like much... until you realize that the Earth was
only about 6 &deg;C colder during the last ice age, and the Antarctic
had no ice the last time the Earth was about 4 &deg;C warmer.  You
also need to bear in mind the shocking <i>suddenness</i> of the
current rise in carbon dioxide levels

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr_Rev_png">
<img border = "none" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr_Rev.jpg" />
</a>
</div>

<p>
You can see several ice ages here &mdash; or technically, 'glacial
periods'.  Carbon dioxide concentration and temperature go hand in
hand, probably due to some feedback mechanisms that make each
influence the other.  But the scary part is the vertical line on the
right where the carbon dioxide shoots up from 290 to 390 parts per
million &mdash; <i>instantaneously</i> from a geological point of
view, and to levels not seen for a long time.  Species can adapt to
slow climate changes, but we're trying a radical experiment here.

<p>
But what, specifically, could be the effects of a world that's 3
&deg;C warmer?  You can get some idea from the <a
href="http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&amp;page=22">National
Research Council report</a>.  Here are some of their predictions.  I
think it's important to read these, to see that <i>bad things will
happen, but the world will not end</i>.  Psychologically, it's easy to
avoid taking action if you think there's no problem &mdash; but it's
also easy if you think you're doomed and there's no point.

<p>
Between their predictions (in boldface) I've added a few comments of
my own.  These comments are not supposed to <i>prove</i> anything.
They're just anecdotal examples of the kind of events the report says
we should expect.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>For 3 &deg;C of global warming, 9 out of 10 northern
hemisphere summers will be "exceptionally warm": warmer in most land
areas than all but about 1 of the summers from 1980 to 2000.</b></ul>

<p>
This summer has certainly been exceptionally warm: for example,
worldwide, it was <a
href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100715_globalstats.html">the
hottest June in recorded history</a>, while <a
href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100715_globalstats.html">July
was the second hottest</a>, beat out only by 2003.  Temperature
records have been <a href=
"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544">falling
like dominos</a>. This is a taste of the kind of thing we might see.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>Increases of precipitation at high latitudes and drying of
the already semi-arid regions are projected with increasing global
warming, with seasonal changes in several regions expected to be about
5-10% per degree of warming.  However, patterns of precipitation show
much larger variability across models than patterns of
temperature.</b></ul>

<p>
Back home in southern California we're in our <a
href="http://www.water.ca.gov/drought/docs/timeline-present.pdf">fourth
year of drought</a>, which has led to many <a
href="http://www.miller-mccune.com/science-environment/drought-aiding-wildfires-3508/">wildfires</a>.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>Large increases in the area burned by wildfire are
expected in parts of Australia, western Canada, Eurasia and the United
States.</b></ul>

<p>
We are already getting some unusually intense fires: for example, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires">Black
Saturday bushfires</a> that ripped through Victoria in February 2007,
the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Greek_forest_fires">massive
fires in Greece</a> later that year, and the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires">hundreds of
wildfires that broke out in Russia this July</a>.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>Extreme precipitation events &mdash; that is, days with
the top 15% of rainfall &mdash; are expected to increase by 3-10% per
degree of warming.</b></ul>

<p>
The extent to which these events cause floods, and the extent to which
these floods cause serious damage, will depend on many complex
factors.  But today it hard not to think about the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Pakistan_floods">floods in
Pakistan</a>, which left about 20 million homeless, and ravaged an
area equal to that of California.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>In many regions the amount of flow in streams and rivers is
expected to change by 5-15% per degree of warming, with decreases in
some areas and increases in others.</b></ul>

<p>
<ul><li> <b>The total number of tropical cyclones should decrease slightly or remain unchanged.  Their wind speed is expected to increase by 1-4% per degree of warming.</b></ul>

<p>
It's a bit counterintuitive that warming could decrease the number of cyclones, while making them stronger.  I'll have to learn more about this.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>The annual average sea ice area in the Arctic is expected to decrease by 15% per degree of warming, with more decrease in the summertime.</b></ul>

<p>
The area of Arctic ice <a href=
"http://nsidc.org/news/press/2007_seaiceminimum/20071001_pressrelease.html">reached
a record low in the summer of 2007</a>, and the fabled Northwest
Passage opened up for the first time in recorded history.  Then the
ice area bounced back.  This year it was low again... but what matters
more is the overall trend:

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/">
<img border = "none" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/arctic_sea_ice_1980-2010_NSIDC.jpg" />
</a></div>

<br />&nbsp;<br /> 

<ul><li> <b>Global sea level has risen by about 0.2 meters since 1870.
The sea level rise by 2100 is expected to be at least 0.6 meters due
to thermal expansion and loss of ice from glaciers and small ice caps.
This could be enough to permanently displace as many as 3 million
people &mdash; and raise the risk of floods for many millions more.
Ice loss is also occurring in parts of Greenland and Antarctica, but
the effect on sea level in the next century remains uncertain. </b></ul>

<p>
<ul><li> <b>Up to 2 degrees of global warming, studies suggest that
crop yield gains and adaptation, especially at high latitudes, could
balance losses in tropical and other regions.  Beyond 2 degrees,
studies suggest a rise in food prices.</b></ul>

<p>
The first sentence there is the main piece of <i>good</i> news &mdash;
though not if you're a poor farmer in central Africa.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>Increased carbon dioxide also makes the ocean more acidic
and lowers the ability of many organisms to make shells and skeleta.
Seashells, coral, and the like are made of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonite">aragonite</a>, one of
the two crystal forms of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate">calcium
carbonate</a>.  North polar surface waters will become under-saturated
for aragonite if the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises
to 400-450 parts per million.  Then aragonite will tend to dissolve,
rather than form from seawater.  For south polar surface waters, this
effect will occur at 500-660 ppm.  Tropical surface waters and deep
ocean waters are expected to remain supersaturated for aragonite
throughout the 20th century, but coral reefs may be negatively
impacted.</b></ul>

<p>
Coral reefs are also <a
href="http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/dying-coral-reefs/">having
trouble</a> due to warming oceans.  For example, this summer there was
a <a
href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2010/2010-08-16-02.html">mass
dieoff of corals</a> off the coast of Indonesia due to ocean
temperatures that were 4 &deg;C higher than average.

<p>
<ul><li> <b>Species are moving toward the poles to keep cool: the
average shift over many types of terrestrial species has been 6
kilometers per decade.  The rate of extinction of species will be
enhanced by climate change.</b></ul>

<p>
I have a strong fondness for the diversity of animals and plants that
grace this planet, so this particularly perturbs me.  The report does
not venture a guess for how many species may go extinct due to climate
change, probably because it's hard to estimate.  However, it states
that the extinction rate is now roughly 500 times what it was before
humans showed up.  The extinction rate is measured extinctions per
million years per species.  For mammals, it's <a
href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&page=200">shot
up from roughly 0.1-0.5 to roughly 50-200.</a> That's what I call
<i>annoying the biosphere!</i>

<p>
So, that's a brief summary of the problems that carbon dioxide emissions may cause.   There's just one more thing I want to say about this now.

<p>
Once carbon dioxide is put into the atmosphere, about 50% of it will stay there for decades.   About 30% of it will stay there for centuries.  And about 20% will stay there for thousands of years:

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Dioxide_Residence_Time_png">
<img border = "none" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/Carbon_Dioxide_Adjustment_Time.jpg" />
</a>
</div>

<p>
This particular chart is based on some 1993 calculations by Wigley.
Later calculations confirm this idea: the carbon we burn will haunt
our skies essentially forever:

<p>
<ul><li> Mason Inman, <a href=
"http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0812/full/climate.2008.122.html">Carbon
is forever</a>, <i>Nature Reports Climate Change</i>, 20 November
2008.
</ul>

<p>
<i>This is why we're in serious trouble.</i> In the above article,
James Hansen puts it this way:

<p>
<blockquote>
Because of this long CO<sub>2</sub> lifetime, we cannot solve the
climate problem by slowing down emissions by 20% or 50% or even
80%. It does not matter much whether the CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted
this year, next year, or several years from now.  Instead ... we must
identify a portion of the fossil fuels that will be left in the
ground, or captured upon emission and put back into the ground.
</blockquote>

<p>
But I think it's important to be more precise.  We can <i>put off</i>
global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and that may be a
useful thing to do.  But to <i>prevent</i> it, we have to cut our
usage of fossil fuels to a <i>very</i> small level long before we've
used them up.

<p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Carbon_Stabilization_Scenarios_png">
<img border = "none" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/Carbon_Stabilization_Scenarios.jpg" />
</a>
</div>

<p>
Theoretically, another option is to quickly deploy new technologies to
suck carbon dioxide out of the air, or cool the planet in other ways.
But there's almost no chance such technologies will be practical soon
enough to <i>prevent</i> significant global warming.  They may become
important later on, <i>after we've already screwed things up</i>.  We
may be miserable enough to try them, even though they may carry
significant risks of their own.

<p>
So now, some tough questions:

<p>
<b>If we decide to cut our usage of fossil fuels dramatically and
quickly, how can we do it?  How <i>should</i> we do it?  What's the
least painful way?  Or should we just admit that we're doomed to
global warming and learn to live with it, at least until we develop
technologies to reverse it?</b>

<p>
And a few more questions, just for completeness:

<p>
<b>Could this all be just a bad dream &mdash; or more precisely, a
delusion of some sort?  Could it be that everything is actually fine?
Or at least not as bad as you're saying?</b>

<p>
I won't attempt to answer any of these now.  We'll have to keep coming
back to them, over and over.

<p>
So far I've only talked about carbon dioxide emissions.  There are
lots of other problems we should tackle, too!  But presumably many of
these are just symptoms of some deeper underlying problem.  What is
this deeper problem?  I've been trying to figure that out for years.
Is there any way to summarize what's going on, or it is just a big
complicated mess?

<p>
Here's my attempt at a quick summary: the human race makes big
decisions based on an economic model that ignores many negative
externalities.

<p>
A <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative">'negative
externality'</a> is, very roughly, a way in which my actions impose a
cost on you, for which I don't pay any price.

<p>
For example: suppose I live in a high-rise apartment and my toilet
breaks.  Instead of fixing it, I realize that I can just use a bucket
&mdash; and throw its contents out the window!  Whee!  If society has
no mechanism for dealing with people like me, I pay no price for doing
this.  But you, down there, will be very unhappy.

<p>
This isn't just theoretical.  Once upon a time in Europe there were
few private toilets, and people would shout "gardyloo!" before
throwing their waste down to the streets below.  In retrospect that
seems disgusting, but many of the big problems that afflict us now can
be seen as the result of equally disgusting externalities.  For
example:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">Carbon dioxide pollution caused by burning fossil fuels.</a></b>  If the expected costs of global warming and ocean acidification were included in the price of fossil fuels, other sources of energy would more quickly become competitive.  This is the idea behind a carbon tax or a 'cap-and-trade program' where companies pay for permits to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

<p>
<li> <b><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_%28ecology%29">Dead
zones</a></b>.  Put too much nitrogen and phosophorus in the river,
and lots of algae will grow in the ocean near the river's mouth.  When
the algae dies and rots, the water runs out of dissolved oxygen, and
fish cannot live there.  Then we have a 'dead zone'.  Dead zones are
<a
href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/321/5891/926">expanding
and increasing in number</a>.  For example, there's one about 20,000
square kilometers in size near the mouth of the Mississippi River.
Hog farming, chicken farming and runoff from fertilized crop lands are
largely to blame.

<p>
<li> <b><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfishing">Overfishing</a>.</b>
Since there is no ownership of fish, everyone tries to catch as many
fish as possible, even though this is depleting fish stocks to the
point of near-extinction. There's evidence that populations of all big
predatory ocean fish have dropped 90% since 1950.  Populations of cod,
bluefish tuna and many other popular fish have plummeted, despite
feeble attempts at regulation.

<p>
<li> <b><a
href="http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/Global.aspx">Species
extinction due to habitat loss</a>.</b> Since the economic value of
intact ecosystems has not been fully reckoned, in many parts of the
world there's little price to pay for destroying them.

<p>
<li> <b><a
href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/popnews/Newsltr_87.pdf">Overpopulation</a>.</b>
Rising population is a major cause of the stresses on our biosphere,
yet it costs less to have your own child than to adopt one.  (However,
a pilot project in India is offering cash payments to couples who put
off having children for two years after marriage.)
</ul>

<p>
One could go on; I haven't even bothered to mention many well-known
forms of air and water pollution.  The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Rain_Program">Acid Rain
Program</a> in the United States is an example of how people
eliminated an externality: they imposed a cap-and-trade system on
sulfur dioxide pollution.

<p>
Externalities often arise when we treat some resource as essentially
infinite &mdash; for example fish, or clean water, or clean air.  We
thus impose no cost for using it.  This is fine at first.  But because
this resource is free, we use more and more &mdash; until it no longer
makes sense to act as if we have an infinite amount.  As a physicist
would say, the approximation breaks down, and we enter a new regime.

<p>
This is happening all over the place now.  We have reached the point
where we need to treat most resources as finite and take this into
account in our economic decisions.  We can't afford so many
externalities.  It is irrational to let them go on.

<p>
But what can <i>you</i> do about this?  Or what can <i>I</i> do?  

<p>
We can do the things anyone can do.  Educate ourselves. Educate our
friends.  Vote.  Conserve energy.  Don't throw buckets of crap out of
apartment windows.

<p>
But what can we do that maximizes our effectiveness by taking
advantage of our special skills?

<p>
Starting now, a large portion of <i>This Week's Finds</i> will be the
continuing story of my attempts to answer this question.  I want to
answer it for myself.  I'm not sure what <i>I</i> should do.  But
since I'm a scientist, I'll pose the question a bit more broadly, to
make it a bit more interesting.

<p>
<i>How scientists can help save the planet</i> &mdash; that's what I want to know.
