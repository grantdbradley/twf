<p>Anyone seriously interested in global warming needs to learn about the 'ice ages', or more technically 'glacial periods'.  After all, these are some of the most prominent <i>natural</i> variations in the Earth's temperature.  And they're rather mysterious.   They could be caused by changes in the Earth's orbit called <a href = "http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Milankovitch+cycle">Milankovich cycles</a>... but the evidence is not completely compelling.  I want to talk about that.</p>

<p>But to understand ice ages, the first thing we need to know is that the Earth hasn't always had them!  The Earth's climate has been cooling and becoming more erratic for the last 35 million years, with full-blown glacial periods kicking in only about 1.8 million years ago.  </p>

<p>So, this week let's start with a little tour of the Earth's climate history.  Somewhat arbitrarily, let's begin with the extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago.   Here's a graph of what the temperature has been doing since then:</p>

<p><div align = "center">
<a href = "http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:65_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/65Myr.png" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>Of course you should have lots of questions about how this graph was made, and how well we really know these ancient temperatures!  But for now I'm just giving a quick overview&mdash;click on the graphs for more.  In future weeks I should delve into more technical details.  </p>

<p><h3> The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Paleocene Epoch</a>, 65 - 55 million years ago </h3></p>

<p>The Paleocene began with a bang, as an <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">asteroid 10 kilometers across</a> hit the Gulf of Mexico in an explosion <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#Impact_specifics">two million times larger</a> than the biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated.  A <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatsunami">megatsunami</a> thousands of meters high ripped across the Atlantic, and molten quartz hurled high into the atmosphere ignited wildfires over the whole planet.  A day to remember, for sure.</p>

<p>The Earth looked like this back then:</p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://www.scotese.com/K/t.htm"><img src = "http://www.scotese.com/images/066.jpg" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>The Paleocene started out <i>hot</i>: the ocean was 10&deg; to 15&deg; Celsius warmer than today.   Then it got even hotter!  Besides a gradual temperature rise, at the very end of this epoch there was a drastic incident called the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>&mdash; that's the spike labelled &quot;PETM&quot;. Ocean surface  temperatures worldwide shot up by 5-8&deg;C for a few thousand years&mdash;but in the Arctic, it heated up even more, to a balmy 23&deg;C.   This caused a severe dieoff of little ocean critters called <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a>, and a drastic change of the dominant mammal species.  What caused it?  That's a good question, but right now I'm just giving you a quick tour.  </p>

<p><h3> The <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene">Eocene Epoch</a>, 55 - 34 million years ago </h3></p>

<p>During the Eocene, temperatures continued to rise until the so-called 'Eocene Optimum', about halfway through.  Even at the start, the continents were close to where they are now&mdash;but the average annual temperature in arctic Canada and Siberia was a balmy 18 &deg;C.  The dominant plants up there were palm trees and cycads.  Fossil monitor lizards (sort of like alligators)  dating back to this era have been found in <a href = 
"http://www.mapzones.com/world/europe/greenland/mapindex.php">Svalbard</a>,  an island north of Greenland that's now covered with ice all year.  Antarctica was home to cool temperate forests, including  beech trees and ferns.  In particular, our Earth had <i>no permanent polar ice caps!</i>  </p>

<p>Life back then was very different.   The biggest member of the order <a href = "http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Carnivora&amp;contgroup=Eutheria">Carnivora</a>, which now includes dogs, cats, bears, and the like, was merely the size of a housecat.  The largest predatory mammals were of another, now extinct order: the <a href = "http://www.paleocene-mammals.de/predators.htm">creodonts</a>, like this one drawn by Dmitry Bogdanov:</p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonta">
<img width = "300" src = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Patriofelis22DB.jpg" alt = ""/></a>
</div></p>

<p>But the biggest predator of all was not a mammal: it was
<a href =  "http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca//flightless/diatryma.htm">Diatryma</a>,  the 8-foot tall &quot;terror bird&quot;, with a fearsome beak!</p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creodonta">
<img width = "300" src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/diatryma.jpg" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>But it's not as huge as it looks here, because horses were only <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse#Hyracotherium">half a meter high back then</a>!</p>

<p>For more on this strange world and its end as the Earth cooled, see:</p>

<p><ul><li> Donald R. Prothero, <i>The Eocene-Oligocene Transition: Paradise Lost</i>, Critical Moments in Paleobiology and Earth History Series, Columbia University Press, New York, 1994.</ul></li></p>

<p><h3> The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene">Oligocene Epoch</a>, 34 - 24 million years ago</h3></p>

<p>As the Eocene drew to a close, temperatures began to drop.  And at the start of the Oligocene, they plummeted!   Glaciers started forming in Antarctica.  The growth of ice sheets led to a dropping of the sea level. Tropical jungles gave ground to cooler woodlands.  </p>

<p>What caused this?  That's another good question.  Some seek the answer in plate tectonics.  The Oligocene is when India collided with Asia, throwing up the Himalayas and the vast Tibetan plateau. Some argue this led to a significant change in global weather patterns. But this is also the time when Australia and South America finally separated from Antarctica. Some argue that the formation of an ocean completely surrounding Antarctica led to the cooling weather patterns. After all, that lets cold water go round and round Antarctica without ever being driven up towards the equator.</p>

<p><h3> The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene">Miocene Epoch</a>, 24 - 5.3 million years ago </h3></p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://www.scotese.com/miocene.htm"><img src = "http://www.scotese.com/images/014.jpg" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>Near the end of the Oligocene temperatures shot up again and the Antarctic thawed.   Then it cooled, then it warmed again... but by the middle of the Miocene, temperatures began to drop more seriously, and glaciers again formed on the Antarctic.  It's been frozen ever since.  Why all these temperature fluctuations?  That's another good question. </p>

<p>The Miocene is when grasslands first became common. It's sort of amazing that something we take so much for granted&mdash;grass&mdash;can be so new! But grasslands, as opposed to thicker forests and jungles, are characteristic of cooler climates. And as Nigel Calder has suggested, grasslands were crucial to the development of humans!  Early hominids lived on the border between forests and grasslands.  That has a lot to do with why we stand on our hind legs and have hands rather than paws.  Much later, the agricultural revolution relied heavily on grasses like <a href = "http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph12.htm">wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, rye, and millet</a>. As we ate more of these plants, we drastically transformed them by breeding, and removed forests to grow more grasses.  In return, the grasses drastically transformed us: the ability to stockpile surplus grains ended our hunter-gatherer lifestyle and gave rise to cities, kingdoms, and slave labor.</p>

<p>So, you could say we coevolved with grasses!</p>

<p>Indeed, the sequence of developments leading to humans came shortly after the rise of grasslands. Apes split off from monkeys 21 million years ago, in the Miocene. The genus <i>Homo</i> split off from other apes like gorillas and chimpanzees 5 million years ago, near the beginning of the Pliocene.  The fully bipedal <i>Homo erectus</i> dates back to 1.9 million years ago, near the end of the Pliocene.  But we're getting ahead of ourselves...</p>

<p><h3> The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene">Pliocene Epoch</a>, 5.3 - 1.8 million years ago </h3></p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev_png"><img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/5Myr.png" alt = ""></a></div></p>

<p>Starting around the Pliocene, the Earth's temperature has been getting every more <i>jittery</i> as it cools.  Something is making the temperature unstable!  And these fluctuations are not just getting more severe&mdash;they're also lasting longer. </p>

<p>These temperature fluctuations are not really periodic, despite the optimistic labels on the above graph saying "41 kiloyear cycle" and "100 kiloyear cycle".  And beware: the data in the above graph was manipulated so it would synchronize with the Milankovitch cycles!  Is that really justified?  Do these cycles really cause the changes in the Earth's climate?  More good questions.</p>

<p>Here's a graph that shows more clearly the noisy nature of the Earth's climate in the last 7 million years:</p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pliocene_benthic_carbonate_18O.png"><img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/7Myr.png" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>You can tell this graph was made by a real paleontologist, because they like to put the present on the <i>left</i> instead of on the right. </p>

<p>And maybe you're getting curious about this "&delta;<sup>18</sup>O benthic carbonate" business?  Well, we can't directly measure the temperatures long ago by sticking a thermometer into an ancient rock!   We need to use <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_%28climate%29">'climate proxies'</a>: things we can measure now, that we <i>believe</i> are correlated to features of the climate long ago.  &delta;<sup>18</sup>O is the change in the amount of <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen-18">oxygen-18</a> (a less common, heavier isotope of oxygen) in carbonate deposits dug up from ancient ocean sediments.  These deposits were made by <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera">foraminifera</a> and other tiny ocean critters.  The amount of oxygen-18 in these deposits is used as temperature proxy: the more of it there is, the colder we think it was.  Why?  That's <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O">another good question</a>.</p>

<p><h3> The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene">Pleistocene Epoch</a>, 1.8 - .01 million years ago </h3></p>

<p>By the beginning of the Pleistocene, the Earth's jerky temperature variations became full-fledged <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age">'glacial cycles'</a>.  In the last million years there have been about ten glacial cycles, though it's hard to count them in any precise way&mdash;it's like counting mountains in a mountain range:</p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature.html#6Myr"><img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/6Myr.jpg" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>Now the present is on the right again&mdash;but just to keep you on your toes, here <i>up</i> means <i>cold</i>, or at least more oxygen-18.  I copied this graph from:</p>

<p><ul><li> Barry Saltzman, <em>Dynamical Paleoclimatology: Generalized
Theory of Global Climate Change</em>, Academic Press, New York,
2002, fig. 1-4.</ul></li></p>

<p>We can get some more detail on the last four glacial periods from the change in the amount of deuterium in <a href = "http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok.html">Vostok</a> and <a href = "http://www.esf.org/index.php?id=855">EPICA</a> ice core samples, and also changes in the amount of oxygen-18 in foraminifera (that's the graph labelled 'Ice Volume'):</p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Ice_Age_Temperature_Rev_png"><img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/temperature/450kyr.png" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>As you can see here, the third-to-last glacial ended about 380,000 years ago.  In the warm period that followed, the first signs of <em><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal">Homo neanderthalensis</a></em> appear about 350,000 years ago, and the first  <em><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens">Homo sapiens</a></em> about 250,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Then, 200,000 years ago, came the second-to-last glacial period: the
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolstonian_Stage">
Wolstonian</a>.  This lasted until about 130,000 years ago.  Then came a warm period called the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian">Eemian</a>, which lasted until about 110,000 years ago.  During the Eemian, Neanderthalers hunted rhinos in Switzerland!  It was a bit warmer then that it is now, and sea levels may have been about 4-6 meters higher&mdash;worth thinking about, if you're interested in the effects of global warming.  </p>

<p>The last glacial period started around 110,000 years ago.  This is called the Winsconsinan or W&uuml;rm period, depending on location... but let's just call it the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period">last glacial period</a>.   </p>

<p>A lot happened during the last glacial period.  <i>Homo sapiens</i> reached the Middle East 100,000 years ago, and arrived in central Asia 50 thousand years ago.  The Neanderthalers died out in Asia around that time.  They died out in Europe 35 thousand years ago, about when <i>Homo sapiens</i> got there.  Anyone notice a pattern?</p>

<p>The oldest cave paintings are 32 thousand years old, and the oldest known calendars and flutes also date back to about this time.   It's striking how many radical innovations go back to about this time.  </p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://www.scotese.com/lastice.htm"><img src = "http://www.scotese.com/images/LGM.jpg" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<p>The glaciers reached their maximum extent around 26 to 18 thousand years ago.   There were ice sheets down to the Great Lakes in America, and covering the British Isles, Scandinavia, and northern Germany.  Much of Europe was tundra.   And so much water was locked up in ice that the sea level was <a href = "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_hist_intro.html">120 meters lower</a> than it is today!  </p>

<p>Then things started to warm up.  About 18 thousand years ago, <i>Homo sapiens</i> arrived in America.   In Eurasia, people started cultivating plants and herding of animals around this time.  </p>

<p>There was, however, a shocking setback 12,700 years ago: the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas">Younger Dryas</a> episode, a cold period lasting about 1,300 years.  We talked about this in <a href = "http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/this-weeks-finds-week-304/">"week304"</a>, so I won't go into it again here.  </p>

<p>The Younger Dryas ended about 11,500 years ago.  The last glacial period, and with it the Pleistocene, officially ended 10,000 years ago.  Or more precisely: 10,000 BP.  Whenever I've been saying 'years ago', I really mean <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Present">Before Present</a>, where the 'present', you'll be amused to learn, is officially set in 1950.  Of course the precise definition of 'the present' doesn't matter much for very ancient events, but it would be annoying if a thousand years from now we had to revise all the textbooks to say the Pleistocene ended 11,000 years ago.  It'll still be 10,000 BP.  </p>

<p>(But if 1950 was the <i>present</i>, now it's the <i>future!</i>  This could explain why such weird science-fiction-type stuff is happening.)</p>

<p><h3> The <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene">Holocene Epoch</a>, .01 - 0 million years ago </h3></p>

<p>As far as geology goes, the Holocene is a rather silly epoch, not like the rest.  It's just a name for the time since the last ice age ended.  In the long run it'll probably be called the Early <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a>, since it marks the start of truly massive impacts of <i>Homo sapiens</i> on the biosphere.  We may have started killing off species in the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event">late Pleistocene</a>, but now <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">we're killing more</a>&mdash;and changing the climate, perhaps even <a href = "http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/archer.2005.trigger.pdf">postponing the next glacial period</a>.</p>

<p>Here's what the temperature has been doing since 12,000 BC:</p>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Rev_png"><img src = "http://www.globalwarmingart.com/images/b/bb/Holocene_Temperature_Variations_Rev.png" alt = ""/></a></div></p>

<br/>
<p>Finally, here's a closeup of a tiny sliver of time: the last 2000 years:</p>
<br/>

<p><div align = "center"><a href = "http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison_png"><img src = "http://www.globalwarmingart.com/images/c/c1/2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png"></a></div></p>

<p>In both these graphs, different colored lines correspond to different studies; click for details.  The biggish error bars give people lots to argue about, as you may have noticed.  But right now I'm more interested in the big picture, and questions like these:</p>

<p><ul><li> Why was it so hot in the early Eocene?</ul></li></p>

<p><ul><li> Why has it generally been cooling down ever since the Eocene?</ul></li></p>

<p><ul><li>  Why have temperature fluctuations been growing since the Miocene? </ul></li></p>

<p><ul><li>  What causes the glacial cycles? </ul></li></p>

<p><h3>For More</h3></p>

<p>Next time we'll get into a bit more detail.  For now, here are some fun easy things to read.  </p>

<p>This is a very enjoyable overview of climate change during the Holocene, and its effect on human civilization:</p>

<p><ul><li> Brian Fagan, <i>The Long Summer</i>, Basic Books, New York, 2005.  Summary available at <a href = "http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/The+Long+Summer">Azimuth Library</a>.</ul></li></p>

<p>These dig a bit further back:</p>

<p><ul><li> Chris Turney, <i>Ice, Mud and Blood: Lessons from Climates Past</i>, Macmillan, New York, 2008.</ul></li></p>

<p><ul><li> Steven Mithen, <i>After the Ice: A Global Human History 20,000-5000 BC</i>, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005.</ul></li></p>

<p>I couldn't stomach the style of the second one: it's written as a narrative, with a character named Lubbock travelling through time.  But a lot of people like it, and they say it's well-researched.</p>

<p>For a history of how people discovered and learned about ice ages, try:</p>

<p><ul><li> Doug Macdougall, <i>Frozen Earth: The Once and Future Story of Ice Ages</i>, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2004.</ul></li></p>

<p>For something a bit more technical, but still introductory, try:</p>

<p><ul><li> Richard W. Battarbee and Heather A. Binney, <i>Natural Climate Variability and Global Warming: a Holocene Perspective</i>, Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, 2008.</ul></li></p>

<p>To learn how this graph was made:</p>

<p>and to read a good overview of the Earth's climate throughout the Cenozoic, try this:</p>

<p><ul><li> James Zachos, Mark Pagani, Lisa Sloan, Ellen Thomas and Katharina Billups, <a href = "http://www.essc.psu.edu/essc_web/seminars/spring2006/jan18/Zachosetal.pdf">Trends, rhythms, and aberrations in global climate 65 Ma to present</a>, <a href = "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5517/686"><i>Science</i></a> <b>292</b> (27 April 2001), 686-693.</ul></li></p>

<p>I got the beautiful maps illustrating continental drift from here:</p>

<p><ul><li> Christopher R. Scotes, <a href = "http://www.scotese.com/">Paleomap Project</a>.</ul></li></p>

<p>and I urge you to check out this website for a nice visual tour of the Earth's history.</p>

<p>Finally, I thank Frederik de Roo and Nathan Urban for suggesting improvements to this issue.  You can see what they said <a href = "http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Mathforge/Azimuth/comments.php?DiscussionID=758&amp;Focus=4842#Comment_4842">on the Azimuth Forum</a>.  If you <a href = "http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Forum+help">join</a> the forum, you too can help write This Week's Finds!  I could really use help from earth scientists, biologists, paleontologists and folks like that: I'm okay at math and physics, but I'm trying to broaden the scope now.</p>
