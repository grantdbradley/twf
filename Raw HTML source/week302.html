In &quot;<a href =
"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week301.html">week301</a>&quot; I
sketched a huge picture in a very broad brush.  Now I'd like to start
filling in a few details: not just about the problems we face, but
also about what we can do to tackle them.  For the reasons I explained
last time, I'll focus on what <i>scientists</i> can do.

<P>
As I'm sure you've noticed, different people have radically different
ideas about the mess we're in, or if there even <i>is</i> a mess.

<P>
Maybe carbon emissions are causing really dangerous global warming.
Maybe they're not &mdash; or at least, maybe it's not as bad as some
say.  Maybe we need to switch away from fossil fuels to solar power,
or wind.  Maybe nuclear power is the answer, because solar and wind
are intermittent.  Maybe nuclear power is <i>horrible!</i> Maybe using
less energy is the key.  But maybe boosting efficiency isn't the way
to accomplish that.  

<P>
Maybe the problem is way too big for any of these
conventional solutions to work.  Maybe we need carbon sequestration:
like, pumping carbon dioxide underground.  Maybe we need to get
serious about geoengineering &mdash; you know, something like giant
mirrors in space, to cool down the Earth.  Maybe geoengineering is
absurdly impractical &mdash; or maybe it's hubris on our part to think
we could do it right!  Maybe some radical new technology is the
answer, like nanotech or biotech.  Maybe we should build an
intelligence greater than our own and let <i>it</i> solve our
problems.  

<P>
Maybe all this talk is absurd.  Maybe all we need are some old
technologies, like traditional farming practices, or biochar: any
third-world peasant can make charcoal and bury it, harnessing the
power of nature to do carbon sequestration without fancy machines.  
In fact, maybe we need go back to nature and <i>get rid of</i> the
modern technological civilization that's causing our problems.  Maybe
this would cause massive famines.  But maybe they're bound to come
anyway: maybe overpopulation lies at the root of our problems and only
a population crash will solve them.  Maybe that idea just proves what
we've known all along: the environmental movement is fundamentally
<i>anti-human</i>.

<P>
Maybe all this talk is just focusing on symptoms: what we need is a
<i>fundamental change in consciousness</i>.  Maybe that's not
possible.  Maybe we're just doomed.  Or maybe we'll muddle through the
way we always do.  Maybe, in fact, things are just fine!

<p>
To help sift through this mass of conflicting opinions, 
I think I'll start by interviewing some people.  

<div align = "center">
<a href = "http://www.princeton.edu/~nurban/">
<img border = "2"

</a>
</div>

<P> I'll start with <a href =
"http://www.princeton.edu/~nurban/">Nathan Urban</a>, for a couple of
reasons.  First, he can help me understand climate science and the
whole business of how we can assess risks due to climate change.
Second, like me, he started out working on quantum gravity!  Can I be
happy switching from pure math and theoretical physics to more
practical stuff?  Maybe talking to him will help me find out.

<P>
So, here is the first of several conversations with Nathan Urban.  This time 
we'll talk about what it's like to shift careers, how he got interested
in climate change, and issue of &quot;<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity">climate sensitivity</a>&quot;: how much the
temperature changes if you double the amount of carbon dioxide in the
Earth's atmosphere.

<p>
<b>JB</b>: It's a real pleasure to interview you, since you've successfully
made a transition that I'm trying to make now &mdash; from &quot;science for
its own sake&quot; to work that may help save the planet.

<P>
I can't resist telling our readers that when we first met, you had
applied to U.C. Riverside because you were interested in working on
quantum gravity.  You wound up going elsewhere... and now you're at
Princeton, at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs, working on &quot;global climate change from an Earth system
perspective, with an emphasis on Bayesian data-model calibration,
probabilistic prediction, risk assessment, and decision
analysis&quot;.  That's quite a shift!

<P>
I'm curious about how you got from point A to point B. What was the
hardest thing about it?

<P>
<b>NU</b>: I went to Penn State because it had a big physics department and
one of the leading centers in quantum gravity.  A couple years into my
degree my nominal advisor, Lee Smolin, moved to the Perimeter
Institute in Canada.  PI was brand new and didn't yet have a formal
affiliation with a university to support graduate students, so it was
difficult to follow him there.  I ended up staying at Penn State, but
leaving gravity.  That was the hardest part of my transition, as I'd
been passionately interested in gravity since high school.

<P>
I ultimately landed in computational statistical mechanics, partly due
to the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte 
Carlo</a> computing background I'd acquired studying the
dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity.  My thesis work
was interesting, but by the time I graduated, I'd decided it probably
wasn't my long term career.

<P>
During graduate school I had become interested in statistics.  This
was partly from my Monte Carlo simulation background, partly from a
Usenet thread on Bayesian statistics (archived on your <a href =
"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/bayes.html">web page</a>), and partly
from my interest in statistical machine learning.  I applied to a
postdoc position in climate change advertised at Penn State which
involved statistics and decision theory.  At the time I had no
particular plan to remain at Penn State, knew nothing about climate
change, had no prior interest in it, and was a little skeptical that
the whole subject had been exaggerated in the media ... but I was
looking for a job and it sounded interesting and challenging, so I
accepted.

<P>
I had a great time with that job, because it involved a lot of
statistics and mathematical modeling, was very interdisciplinary &mdash;
incorporating physics, geology, biogeochemistry, economics, public
policy, etc. &mdash; and tackled big, difficult questions.  Eventually it
was time to move on, and I accepted a second postdoc at Princeton
doing similar things.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: It's interesting that you applied for that Penn State position
even though you knew nothing about climate change.  I think there are
lots of scientists who'd like to work on environmental issues but feel
they lack the necessary expertise.  Indeed I sometimes feel that way
myself!  So what did you do to bone up on climate change?  Was it
important to start by working with a collaborator who knew more about
that side of things?

<P>
<b>NU</b>: I think a physics background gives people the confidence (or
arrogance!) to jump into a new field, trusting their quantitative
skills to see them through.

<P>
It was very much like starting over as a grad student again &mdash; an
experience I'd had before, switching from gravity to condensed matter
&mdash; except faster.  I read.  A lot.  But at the same time, I worked on
a narrowly defined project, in collaboration with an excellent mentor,
to get my feet wet and gain depth.  The best way to learn is probably
to just try to answer some specific research question.  You can pick
up what you need to know as you go along, with help.  (One difficulty
is in identifying a good and accessible problem!)

<P>
I started by reading the papers cited by the paper upon whose work my
research was building.  The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report came out
shortly after that, which cites many more key references.  I started
following new articles in major journals, whatever seemed interesting
or relevant to me.  I also sampled some of the blog debates on climate
change.  Those were useful to understand what the public's view of the
important controversies may be, which is often very different from the
actual controversies within the field.  Some posters were willing to
write useful tutorials on some aspects of the science as well.  And of
course I learned through research, through attending group meetings
with collaborators, and talking to people.

<P>
It's very important to start out working with a knowledgeable
collaborator, and I'm lucky to have many.  The history of science is
littered with very smart people making serious errors when they get
out of their depth.  The physicist Leo Szilard once told a biologist
colleague to &quot;assume infinite intelligence and zero prior
knowledge&quot; when explaining to him.  The error some make is in
believing that intelligence alone will suffice.  You also have to
acquire knowledge, and become intimately familiar with the relevant
scientific literature.  And you will make mistakes in a new field, no
matter how smart you are.  That's where a collaborator is crucial:
someone who can help you identify flaws in arguments that you may not
notice yourself at first.  (And it's not just to start with, either: I
still need collaborators to teach me things about specific models, or
data sets, that I don't know.)  Collaborators also can help you become
familiar with the literature faster.

<P>
It's helpful to have a skill that others need.  I've built up
expertise in statistical data-model comparison.  I read as many
statistics papers as I do climate papers, have statistician
collaborators, and can speak their own language.  I can act as an
intermediary between scientists and statisticians.  This expertise
allows me to collaborate with some climate research groups who happen
to lack such expertise themselves.  As a result I have a lot of people
who are willing to teach me what they know, so we can solve problems
that neither of us alone could.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: You said you began with a bit of skepticism that perhaps the whole
climate change thing had been exaggerated in the media.  I think a lot
of people feel that way. I'm curious how your attitude evolved as you
began studying the subject more deeply.  That might be a big question,
so maybe we can break it down a little: do you remember the first
thing you read that made you think &quot;Wow!  I didn't know
that!&quot;?

<P>
<b>NU</b>: I'm not sure what was the first.  It could have been that
most of the warming from CO<sub>2</sub> is currently thought to come
from feedback effects, rather than its direct greenhouse effect.  Or
that ice ages (technically, glacial periods) were only 5-6 &deg;C
cooler than our preindustrial climate, globally speaking.  Many people
would guess something much colder, like 10 &deg;C.  It puts future
warming in perspective to think that it could be as large, or even
half as large, as the warming between an ice age and today.  &quot;A
few degrees&quot; doesn't sound like much (especially in Celsius, to
an American), but historically, it can be a big deal &mdash;
particularly if you care about the parts of the planet that warm
faster than the average rate.  Also, I was surprised by the
atmospheric longevity of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.  If
CO<sub>2</sub> is a problem, it will be a problem that's around for a
long time.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: These points are so important that I don't want them to whiz past
too quickly.  So let me back up and ask a few more questions here.

<P>
By &quot;feedback effects&quot;, I guess you mean things like this:
when it gets warmer, ice near the poles tends to melt.  But ice is
white, so it reflects sunlight.  When ice melts, the landscape gets
darker, and absorbs more sunlight, so it gets warmer.  So the warming
effect amplifies itself &mdash; like feedback when a rock band has its
amplifiers turned up too high.

<P>
On the other hand, any sort of cooling effect also amplifies itself.
For example, when it gets colder, more ice forms, and that makes the
landscape whiter, so more sunlight gets reflected, making it even
colder.

<P>
Could you maybe explain some of the main feedback effects and give us
numbers that say how big they are?

<P>
<b>NU</b>: Yes, feedbacks are when a change in temperature causes
changes within the climate system that, themselves, cause further
changes in temperature.  Ice reflectivity, or &quot;<a href = 
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo">albedo</a>&quot;,
feedback is a good example.  Another is water vapor feedback.  When it
gets warmer &mdash; due to, say, the CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse effect &mdash; 
the evaporation-condensation balance shifts in favor of relatively more
evaporation, and the water vapor content of the atmosphere increases.
But water vapor, like CO<sub>2</sub>, is a greenhouse gas, which
causes additional warming.  (The opposite happens in response to
cooling.)  These feedbacks which amplify the original cause (or
&quot;forcing&quot;) are known to climatologists as &quot;positive
feedbacks&quot;.

<P>
A somewhat less intuitive example is the &quot;lapse rate feedback&quot;.  The
greenhouse effect causes atmospheric warming.  But this warming itself
causes the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere to change.
The rate at which air temperature decreases with height, or lapse
rate, can itself increase or decrease.  This change in lapse rate
depends on interactions between radiative transfer, clouds and
convection, and water vapor.  In the tropics, the lapse rate is
expected to decrease in response to the enhanced greenhouse effect,
amplifying the warming in the upper troposphere and suppressing it at
the surface.  This suppression is a &quot;negative feedback&quot; on
surface temperature.  Toward the poles, the reverse happens (a
positive feedback), but the tropics tend to dominate, producing an
overall negative feedback.

<P>
Clouds create more complex feedbacks.  Clouds have both an albedo
effect (they are white and reflect sunlight) and a greenhouse effect.
Low clouds tend to be thick and warm, with a high albedo and weak
greenhouse effect, and so are net cooling agents.  High clouds are
often thin and cold, with low albedo and strong greenhouse effect, and
are net warming agents. Temperature changes in the atmosphere can
affect cloud amount, thickness, and location.  Depending on the type
of cloud and how temperature changes alter its behavior, this can
result in either positive or negative feedbacks.

<P>
There are other feedbacks, but these are usually thought of as the big
four: surface albedo (including ice albedo), water vapor, lapse rate,
and clouds.

<P>
For the strengths of the feedbacks, I'll refer to climate model
predictions, mostly because they're neatly summarized in one place:

<P>
&bull; <a href =
"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter8.pdf#page=41">Section
8.6</a> of the <a href = "http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm">
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report,
Working Group 1</a> (AR4 WG1).

<P>
There are also estimates made from observational data.  (Well, data
plus simple models, because you need some kind of model of how
temperatures depend on CO<sub>2</sub>, even if it's just a simple
linear feedback model.)  But observational estimates are more
scattered in the literature and harder to summarize, and some
feedbacks are very difficult to estimate directly from data.  This is
a problem when testing the models.  For now, I'll stick to the models
&mdash; not because they're necessarily more credible than observational
estimates, but just to make my job here easier.

<P>
Conventions vary, but the feedbacks I will give are measured in units
of watts per square meter per kelvin.  That is, they tell you how much
of a radiative imbalance, or power flux, the feedback creates in the
climate system in response to a given temperature change.  The
reciprocal of a feedback tells you how much temperature change you'd
get in response to a given forcing.

<P>
Water vapor is the largest feedback.  Referring to this paper cited in
the AR4 WG1 report:

<P>
&bull; Brian J. Solden and Isaac M. Held, <a href =
"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3799.1">An assessment
of climate feedbacks in coupled ocean-atmosphere models</a>,
<i>Journal of Climate</i> <b>19</b> (2006), 3354-3360.

<P>
you can see that climate models predict a range of water
vapor feedbacks of 1.48 to 2.14 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K.  

<P>
The second largest in magnitude is lapse rate feedback,
-0.41 to -1.27 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K.  However, water vapor and
lapse rate feedbacks are often combined into a single feedback,
because stronger water vapor feedbacks also tend to produce stronger
lapse rate feedbacks.  The combined water vapor+lapse rate feedback
ranges between 0.81 to 1.20 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K.

<P>
Clouds are the next largest feedback, 0.18 to 1.18 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K.
But as you can see, different models can predict very different cloud
feedbacks.  It is the largest feedback uncertainty.

<P>
After that comes the surface albedo feedback.  Its range is 0.07 to
0.34 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K.

<P>
People don't necessarily find feedback values intuitive.  Since
everyone wants to know what that means in terms of the climate, I'll
explain how to convert feedbacks into temperatures.

<P>
First, you have to assume a given amount of radiative forcing: a
stronger greenhouse effect causes more warming.  For reference, let's
consider a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, which is estimated
to create a greenhouse effect forcing of 4&plusmn;0.3 W/m<sup>2</sup>.
(The error bars represent the range of estimates I've seen, and aren't
any kind of statistical bound.)  How much greenhouse warming?  In the
absence of feedbacks, about 1.2&plusmn;0.1 &deg;C of warming.

<P>
How much warming, including feedbacks?  To convert a feedback to a
temperature, add it to the so-called &quot;Planck feedback&quot; to
get a combined feedback which accounts for the fact that hotter bodies
radiate more infrared.  Then divide it into the forcing and flip the
sign to get the warming.  Mathematically, this is....

<P>
<b>JB:</b> Whoa!  Slow down!  I'm glad you finally mentioned the &quot;Planck
feedback&quot;, because this is the mother of all feedbacks, and we
should have talked about it <i>first</i>.  

<P> 
While the name &quot;Planck feedback&quot;
sounds technical, it's pathetically simple: hotter things radiate more 
heat, so they tend to cool down.  Cooler things radiate less heat, so
they tend to warm up.   So this is a negative feedback.   And this is
what keeps our climate from spiralling out of control.

<P>
This is an utterly basic point that amateurs sometimes overlook &mdash;
I did it myself at one stage, I'm embarrassed to admit.  They 
say things like: 

<P>
<blockquote>
&quot;Well, you listed a lot of feedback effects, and overall they
give a positive feedback &mdash; so any bit of warming will cause more
warming, while any bit of cooling will cause more cooling.  But
wouldn't that mean the climate is unstable?  Are you saying that the
climate just happens to be perched at an unstable equilibrium, so
that the slightest nudge would throw us into either an ice age or a
spiral of ever-hotter weather?  That's absurdly unlikely!  
Climate science is a load of baloney!&quot;
</blockquote>

<P>
(Well, I didn't actually say the last sentence: I realized I must be
confused.)

<P>
The answer is that a hot Earth will naturally radiate
away more heat, while a cold Earth will radiate away less.  
And this is enough to make the total feedback <i>negative</i>.

<P>
<b>NU</b>: Yes, the negative Planck feedback is crucial.  Without this
stabilizing feedback, which is always present for any thermodynamic
body, any positive feedback would cause the climate to run away
unstably.  It's so important that other feedbacks are often defined
relative to it: people call the Planck feedback &lambda;<sub>0</sub>, 
and they call the sum of the rest &lambda;.   Climatologists tend to 
take it for granted, and talk about just the non-Planck feedbacks, &lambda;.

<P>
As a side note, the definition of feedbacks in climate science is
somewhat confused; different papers have used different conventions,
some in opposition to conventions used in other fields like
engineering.  For a discussion of some of the ways feedbacks have been
treated in the literature, see:

<P>
&bull; J. R. Bates, Some considerations of the concept of climate
feedback</a>, <i><a href = "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.62">Quarterly
Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society</a></i> <b>133</b> (2007),
545-560.

<P>
<b>JB:</b> Okay.  Sorry to slow you down like that, but we're talking
to a mixed crowd here.  

<P>
So: you were saying how much it warms up when we apply a radiative
forcing F, some number of watts per square meter.  We could do this by
turning up the dial on the Sun, or, more realistically, by pouring
lots of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to keep infrared radiation
from getting out.

<P>
And you said: take the Planck feedback &lambda;<sub>0</sub>,
which is negative, and add to it the sum of all other feedbacks, which we
call &lambda;.   Divide F by the result, and flip the sign to get
the warming.  

<P>
<b>NU:</b>  Right.  Mathematically, that's 

<P>
 T = -F/(&lambda;<sub>0</sub>+&lambda;)

<P>
where

<P> 
&lambda;<sub>0</sub> = -3.2 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K

<P>
is the Planck feedback and &lambda; is the sum of other feedbacks.
Let's look at the forcing from doubled CO<sub>2</sub>:

<P>
F = 4.3 W/m<sup>2</sup>. 

<P>
Here I'm using values taken from Soden and Held.  

<P>
If the other feedbacks vanish (&lambda;=0), this
gives a &quot;no-feedback&quot; warming of T = 1.3 &deg;C, which is
about equal to the 1.2 &deg;C that I mentioned above.

<P>
But we can then plug in other feedback values.  For example, the water
vapor feedbacks 1.48-2.14 W/m<sup>2</sup>/K will produce warmings of 2.5 to 4.1
&deg;C, compared to only 1.3 &deg;C without water vapor feedback.  This is a
huge temperature amplification.  If you consider the combined water
vapor+lapse rate feedback, that's still a warming of 1.8 to 2.2 &deg;C,
almost a doubling of the &quot;bare&quot; CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse warming.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: Thanks for the intro to feedbacks &mdash; very clear.  So,
it seems the &quot;take-home message&quot;, as annoying journalists
like to put it, is this.  When we double the amount of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere, as we're well on the road to doing, we should
expect significantly more than the 1.2 degree Celsius rise in
temperature than we'd get without feedbacks.

<P>
What are the best estimates for exactly how much?  

<P>
<b>NU</b>: The IPCC currently estimates a range of 2 to 4.5 &deg;C for the
overall climate sensitivity (the warming due to a doubling of
CO<sub>2</sub>), compared to the 1.2 &deg;C warming with no feedbacks.
See <a href =
"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter8.pdf#page=41">Section
8.6</a> of the AR4 WG1 report for model estimates and <a href =
"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter9.pdf">Section
9.6</a> for observational estimates.  An excellent review article on
climate sensitivity is:

<P>
&bull; Reto Knutti and Gabriele C. Hegerl, 
<a href = "http://www.iac.ethz.ch/people/knuttir/papers/knutti08natgeo.pdf">The equilibrium sensitivity of the Earth's temperature to radiation changes</a>, <i><a href = "http://www.iac.ethz.ch/people/knuttir/papers/knutti08natgeo.pdf">Nature Geoscience</a></i> <b>1</b> (2008), 735-748.

<P>
I also recommend this review article on linear feedback analysis:

<P>
&bull; Gerard Roe, <a href = "http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/roe/Publications/Roe_FeedbacksRev_08.pdf">Feedbacks, timescales, and seeing red</a>, 
<i><a href = "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.061008.134734">Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Science</a></i> <b>37</b> (2009), 93-115. 

<P>
But note that there are different feedback conventions; Roe's
&lambda; is the negative of the reciprocal of the Soden &amp; Held
&lambda; that I use, i.e. it's a direct proportionality between
forcing and temperature.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: Okay, I'll read those.  

<P>
Here's another obvious question.  You've listed estimates of feedbacks
based on theoretical calculations.  But what's the evidence that these
theoretical feedbacks are actually right?

<P>
<b>NU</b>: As I mentioned, there are also observational estimates of
feedbacks.  There are two approaches: to estimate the total feedback
acting in the climate system, or to estimate all the individual
feedbacks (that we know about).  The former doesn't require us to know
what all the individual feedbacks are, but the second allows us to
verify our physical understanding of physical feedback processes.  I'm
more familiar with the total feedback method, and have published my
own simple estimate as a byproduct of an uncertainty analysis about
the future ocean circulation:

<P>
&bull; Nathan M. Urban and Klaus Keller, <a href =
"http://www.princeton.edu/~nurban/pubs/moc-projections.pdf">Probabilistic
hindcasts and projections of the coupled climate, carbon cycle and
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation system: a Bayesian fusion
of century-scale observations with a simple model</a>, 
<i><a href =

A</a></i>, July 16, 2010.

<P>
I will stick to discussing this method.  To make a long story short,
the observational and model estimates generally agree to within their
estimated uncertainty bounds.  But let me explain a bit more about
where the observational estimates come from.

<P>
To estimate the total feedback, you first estimate the radiative
forcing of the system, based on historic data on greenhouse gases,
volcanic and industrial aerosols, black carbon (soot), solar activity,
and other factors which can change the Earth's radiative balance.
Then you predict how much warming you should get from that forcing
using a climate model, and tune the model's feedback until it matches
the observed warming.  The tuned feedback factor is your observational
estimate.

<P>
As I said earlier, there is no totally model-independent way of
estimating feedbacks &mdash; you have to use some formula to turn forcings
into temperatures.  There is a balance between using simple formulas
with few assumptions, or more realistic models with assumptions that
are harder to verify.  So far people have mostly used simple models,
not only for transparency but also because they're fast enough, and
have few enough free parameters, to undertake a comprehensive
uncertainty analysis.

<P>
What I've described is the &quot;forward model&quot; approach, where
you run a climate model forward in time and match its output to data.
For a trivial linear model of the climate, you can do something even
simpler, which is the closest to a &quot;model independent&quot;
calculation you can get: statistically regress forcing against
temperature.  This is the approach taken by, for example:

<P>
&bull; Piers M. de F. Forster and Jonathan M. Gregory, <a
href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI3611.1">The climate 
sensitivity and its components diagnosed from Earth radiation budget data</a>,
<i><a href =
"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI3611.1">Journal of
Climate</a></i>
<b>19</b> (2006), 39-52.

<P>
In the &quot;total feedback&quot; forward model approach, there are two
major confounding factors which prevent us from making precise feedback
estimates.  One is that we're not sure what the forcing is.  Although
we have good measurements of trace greenhouse gases, there is an
important cooling effect produced by air pollution.  Industrial
emissions create a haze of aerosols in the atmosphere which reflects
sunlight and cools the planet.  While this can be measured, this
direct effect is also supplemented by a far less understood indirect
effect: the aerosols can influence cloud formation, which has its own
climate effect.  Since we're not sure how strong that is, we're not
sure whether there is a strong or a weak net cooling effect from
aerosols.  You can explain the observed global warming with a strong
feedback whose effects are partially cancelled by a strong aerosol
cooling, or with a weak feedback along with weak aerosol cooling.
Without precisely knowing one, you can't precisely determine the
other.

<P>
The other confounding factor is the rate at which the ocean takes up
heat from the atmosphere.  The oceans are, by far, the climate
system's major heat sink.  The rate at which heat mixes into the ocean
determines how quickly the surface temperature responds to a forcing.
There is a time lag between applying a forcing and seeing the full
response realized.  Any comparison of forcing to response needs to
take that lag into account.  One way to explain the surface warming is
with a strong feedback but a lot of heat mixing down into the deeper
ocean, so you don't see all the surface warming at once.  Or you can
do it with a weak feedback, and most of the heat staying near the
surface, so you see the surface warming quickly.  For a discussion,
see:

<P>
We don't know precisely what this rate is, since it's been hard to
monitor the whole ocean over long time periods (and there isn't
exactly a single &quot;rate&quot;, either).

<P>
This is getting long enough, so I'm going to skip over a discussion of
individual feedback estimates.  These have been applied to various
specific processes, such as water vapor feedback, and involve
comparing, say, how the water vapor content of the atmosphere has
changed to how the temperature of the atmosphere has changed.  I'm
also skipping a discussion of paleoclimate estimates of past
feedbacks.  It follows the usual formula of &quot;compare the estimated
forcing to the reconstructed temperature response&quot;, but there are
complications because the boundary conditions were different
(different surface albedo patterns, variations in the Earth's orbit,
or even continental configurations if you go back far enough) and the
temperatures can only be indirectly inferred.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: Thanks for the summary of these complex issues. 
Clearly I've got my reading cut out for me. 

<P>
What do you say to people like Lindzen, who say negative feedbacks 
due to clouds could save the day?

<P>
<b>NU</b>:
Climate models tend to predict a positive cloud feedback, but it's
certainly possible that the net cloud feedback could be negative.
However, Lindzen seems to think it's so negative that it makes the
total climate feedback negative, outweighing all positive feedbacks.
That is, he claims a climate sensitivity even lower than the
&quot;bare&quot; no-feedback value of 1.2 &deg;C.  I think Lindzen's
work has its own problems (there are published responses to his papers
with more details).  But generally speaking, independent of Lindzen's
specific arguments, I don't think such a low climate sensitivity is
supportable by data.  It would be difficult to reproduce the modern
instrumental atmospheric and ocean temperature data with such a low
sensitivity.  And it would be quite difficult to explain the large
changes in the Earth's climate over its geologic history if there were
a stabilizing feedback that strong.  The feedbacks I've mentioned
generally act in response to any warming or cooling, not just from the
CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse effect, so a strongly negative feedback
would tend to prevent the climate from changing much at all.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: Yes, ever since the Antarctic froze over about 12 million years
ago, it seems the climate has become increasingly &quot;jittery&quot;:

As soon as I saw the incredibly jagged curve at the right end of this
graph, I couldn't help but think that some positive feedback is making
it easy for the Earth to flip-flop between warmer and colder states.
But then I wondered what &quot;tamed&quot; this positive feedback and
kept the temperature between certain limits.  I guess that the
negative Planck feedback must be involved.

<P>
<b>NU:</b> You have to be careful: in the figure you
cite, the resolution of the data decreases as you go back in time, so
you can't see all of the variability that could have been present.  A
lot of the high frequency variability (&lt; 100 ky) is averaged out,
so the more recent glacial-interglacial oscillations in temperature
would not have been easily visible in the earlier data if they had
occurred back then.

<P>
That being said, there has been a real change in variability over the
time span of that graph.  As the climate cooled from a
&quot;greenhouse&quot; to an &quot;icehouse&quot; over the Cenozoic
era, the glacial-interglacial cycles were able to start.  These big
swings in climate are a result of ice albedo feedback, when large
continental ice sheets form and disintegrate, and weren't present in
earlier greenhouse climates.  Also, as you can see from the last 5
million years:

</div>

<P>
the glacial-interglacial cycles themselves have gotten bigger over
time (and the dominant period changed from 41 to 100 ky).

<P>
As a side note, the observation that glacial cycles didn't occur in
hot climates highlights the fact that climate sensitivity can be
state-dependent.  The ice albedo feedback, for example, vanishes when
there is no ice.  This is a subtle point when using paleoclimate data
to constrain the climate sensitivity, because the sensitivity at
earlier times might not be the same as the sensitivity now.  Of
course, they are related to each other, and you can make inferences
about one from the other with additional physical reasoning.  I do
stand by my previous remarks: I don't think you can explain past
climate if the (modern) sensitivity is below 1 &deg;C.

<P>
<b>JB</b>:  I have one more question about feedbacks.  It seems that
during the last few glacial cycles, there's sometimes a rise in
temperature <i>before</i> a rise in CO<sub>2</sub> levels.  I've heard
people offer this explanation: warming oceans release CO<sub>2</sub>.
Could that be another important feedback?

<P>
<b>NU</b>: Temperature affects both land and ocean carbon sinks, so it
is another climate feedback (warming changes the amount of
CO<sub>2</sub> remaining in the atmosphere, which then changes
temperature).  The ocean is a very large repository of carbon, and
both absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> from, and emits CO<sub>2</sub> to, the
atmosphere.  Temperature influences the balance between absorption and
emission.  One obvious influence is through the &quot;solubility pump&quot;:
CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves less readily in warmer water, so as
temperatures rise, the ocean can absorb carbon from the atmosphere
less effectively.  This is related to Henry's law in chemistry.

<P>
<b>JB</b>: Henry's law?  Hmm, let me look up the Wikipedia article on
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law">Henry's
law</a>.  Okay, it basically just says that at any fixed
temperature, the amount of carbon dioxide that'll dissolve in water is
proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.  But what
really matters for us is that when it gets warmer, this constant of
proportionality goes down, so the water holds less CO<sub>2</sub>.  
Like you said.

<P>
<b>NU</b>: But this is not the only process going on.  Surface warming
leads to more stratification of the upper ocean layers and can reduce
the vertical mixing of surface waters into the depths.  This is
important to the carbon cycle because some of the dissolved
CO<sub>2</sub> which is in the surface layers can return to the
atmosphere, as part of an equilibrium exchange cycle.  However, some
of that carbon is also transported to deep water, where it can no
longer exchange with the atmosphere, and can be sequestered there for
a long time (about a millennium).  If you reduce the rate at which
carbon is mixed downward, so that relatively more carbon accumulates
in the surface layers, you reduce the immediate ability of the ocean
to store atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in its depths.  This is another
potential feedback.

<P>
Another important process, which is more of a pure carbon cycle
feedback than a climate feedback, is carbonate buffering chemistry.
The straight Henry's law calculation doesn't tell the whole story of
how carbon ends up in the ocean, because there are chemical reactions
going on.  CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with carbonate ions and seawater to
produce bicarbonate ions.  Most of the dissolved carbon in the surface
waters (about 90%) exists as bicarbonate; only about 0.5% is dissolved
CO<sub>2</sub>, and the rest is carbonate.  This &quot;bicarbonate
buffer&quot; greatly enhances the ability of the ocean to absorb
CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere beyond what simple thermodynamic
arguments alone would suggest.  A keyword here is the &quot;<a href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelle_factor">Revelle factor</a>&quot;, which
is the relative ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> to total carbon in the ocean.
(A Revelle factor of 10, which is about the ocean average, means that
a 10% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a 1% increase in dissolved
inorganic carbon.)

<P>
As more CO<sub>2</sub> is added to the ocean, chemical reactions
consume carbonate and produce hydrogen ions, leading to ocean
acidification.  You have already discussed this <a href =
"http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/dying-coral-reefs/">on
your blog</a>.  In addition to acidification, the chemical buffering
effect is lessened (the Revelle factor increased) when there are fewer
carbonate ions available to participate in reactions.  This weakens
the ocean carbon sink.  This is a feedback, but it is a purely carbon
cycle feedback rather than a climate feedback, since only carbonate
chemistry is involved.  There can also be an indirect climate
feedback, if climate change alters the spatial distribution of the
Revelle factor in the ocean by changing the ocean's circulation.

<b>JB:</b> I'm also curious about other feedbacks.  For example, 
I've heard that methane is an even more potent greenhouse gas than 
CO<sub>2</sub>, though it doesn't hang around as long.  And I've 
heard that another big positive feedback mechanism might be the 
release of methane from melting permafrost.  Or maybe even from 
&quot;<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate">methane 
clathrates</a>&quot; down at the bottom of the ocean!  
There's a vast amount of methane down there, locked in cage-shaped 
ice crystals.  As the ocean warms, some of this could be released.  
Some people even worry that this effect could cause a &quot;<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point_%28climatology%29">tipping 
point</a>&quot; in the Earth's climate.  But I won't force you to 
tell me your thoughts on this &mdash; you've done enough for one week.  

<p>
Instead, I just want to make a silly remark about hypothetical
situations where there's so much positive feedback that it 
completely cancels the Planck feedback.  You see, as a
mathematician, I couldn't help wondering about this formula:

<P>
 T = -F/(&lambda;<sub>0</sub>+&lambda;)

<P>
The Planck feedback &lambda;<sub>0</sub> is negative.  The sum of all
the other feedbacks, namely &lambda;, is positive.  So what if they
add up to zero?  Then we're be dividing by zero!  When I last checked, that was a no-no.

<P>
Here's my guess.  If &lambda;<sub>0</sub>+&lambda; becomes zero, 
the climate loses its stability: it can drift freely.  A slight 
tap can push it arbitrarily far, like a ball rolling on a flat table.

<P>
And if &lambda; were actually big enough to make 
&lambda;<sub>0</sub>+&lambda; positive, the climate would 
be downright unstable, like a ball perched on top of a hill!

<P>
But all this is only in some linear approximation.  In reality, 
other effects will eventually kick in.  For example, even in the
case of a runaway greenhouse effect (as on Venus), the temperature 
won't rise indefinitely.  An object radiates power proportional to 
the fourth power of its temperature, so the Planck feedback will
eventually step in and keep the Earth from heating up beyond
a certain point.

<P>
<b>NU</b>: Yes, we do have to be careful to remember that the formula above is
obtained from a linear feedback analysis.  For a discussion of climate
sensitivity in a nonlinear analysis to second order, see:
