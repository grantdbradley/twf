\section*{Foreword}
From January 13, 1993 to August 11th, 2010, I wrote a column called \emph{This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics}. There were a total of 300 issues -- I didn't really do one every week.

After the 300th issue, the column changed to cover a different range of topics. It changed titles too: now it's \emph{This Week's Finds}. It can be found on my blog, \href{http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/}{Azimuth}, as well as my \href{http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html}{website}.

If you read \emph{This Week's Finds} and all the papers and books it links to, you can learn most of the cool stuff I know. Dive in! My goal is to make myself obsolete.

But beware: the things I included are not necessarily more important or better than the things I don't. Mostly I try to write about subjects I actually understand, which limits the selection tremendously. Also: my comments are not intended as ``reviews''. They are simply aimed at getting you interested.

I also love it when people point out mistakes in \emph{This Week's Finds}, ranging from errors of fact to typos and other glitches. So, if you catch a mistake, drop me a line, and I'll try to fix it.

Cytia Beata has compiled this timeline of \emph{This Week's Finds}:
