Here's a book I've been reading lately:

1) Kenneth S. Brown, Cohomology of Groups, Graduate Texts in Mathematics 
182, Springer, 1982.

I should have read this book a long time ago - but I probably wouldn't
have enjoyed it as much as I do now.  All sorts of things I struggled 
to learn for years are neatly laid out here.  Best of all, he comes
right out and admits from the start that the cohomology of groups is
really a branch of \emph{topology}, instead of hiding this fact like some
people do.  

This is something every mathematician should know: you can take any 
group and turn it into a space, thus "reducing" group theory 
to topology.
In particular, if you have any trick for telling spaces apart, like
"cohomology theory", you can apply it to groups as well.

Of course topology is \emph{harder} than group theory in many ways - hence
my quotes around "reducing".  Indeed, algebraic topology was invented
as a trick for reducing topology to group theory!  But, the bridge 
turns out to go both ways, and there's a lot of profitable traffic in 
both directions. 

Ultimately, as James Dolan likes to point out, it's all about the unity of 
mathematics.  Topology is about our concept of \emph{space}, 
while group theory 
is about our concept of \emph{symmetry}... 
but the amazing fact is that they turn 
out to be two aspects of the same big thing!  Mathematics is a source of 
endless surprises, but this is one of the biggest jaw-droppers of all.  

The idea goes back at least to Evariste Galois, who noticed that you can 
classify the ways a little thing can sit in a bigger thing by keeping track 
of what we now call its "Galois group": the group of all 
symmetries of the 
big thing that map the little thing to itself.  For example, you can pick 
out a point or line in the plane by keeping track of which symmetries of 
the plane map this point or line to itself.  

However, the idea of using groups to classify how a little thing sits
in a big one was really made explicit in Felix Klein's 
"Erlangen program", 
a plan for reducing \emph{geometry} to group theory.  

You may know Klein for his famous one-sided bottle:

\begin{quote}
            A mathematician named Klein <br>
            Thought the M&ouml;bius strip was divine. <br>
            Said he: &quot;If you glue <br>
            The edges of two <br>
            You'll get a weird bottle like mine!&quot; <br>

\end{quote}
    
Or maybe you know that the symmetry group of a rectangle, including 
reflections, is called the "Klein 4-group":

\begin{verbatim}
             1 a b c
            ---------
          1| 1 a b c
          a| a 1 c b
          b| b c 1 a
          c| c b a 1
\end{verbatim}
    
He is also known for some other groups called "Kleinian groups", which
act as symmetries of fractal patterns like this:

If you like cool pictures, check out this website!  I've linked you to 
the page that most closely connects to Kleinian groups, but there are 
lots of other more fanciful pictures.   And if you get interested in 
the math lurking behind these fractals, you've \emph{got} to try this book:

3) David Mumford, Caroline Series, and David Wright, Indra's Pearls: 
The Vision of Felix Klein, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2002.

Mumford is a world-class mathematician, so this book is completely
different from the superficial descriptions of fractals one often sees
in math popularizations - but it's still readable, and it's packed with 
beautiful pictures.  You can learn a lot about Kleinian groups from this!

The Kleinian groups arose from Klein's studies of complex functions,
which he considered his best work.  But, he was also a mathematical 
physicist.  Among other things, he wrote a four-volume book on tops 
with one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, Arnold Sommerfeld:

4) Felix Klein and Arnold Sommerfeld, &Uuml;ber die Theorie des Kreisels,
4 vols, 1897-1910.  Reprinted by Johnson, New York, 1965.  Also available
at <A HREF = "http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=ABV7354.0001.001">http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=ABV7354.0001.001</A>

This came after a book he wrote on his own:

5) Felix Klein, The Mathematical Theory of the Top, Scribner's, 
New York, 1887.

This may seem like a lot of books about a kid's toy!  But, tops 
are profoundly related to the rotation group, and the "exactly 
solvable" tops discovered by Euler, Lagrange/Poisson, and 
Sofia Kowalevskaya are solvable because of their symmetries - 
deeply hidden symmetries, in the case of the Kowalevskaya top.  
So, one can imagine why Klein liked this subject.

Klein also wrote a book on the icosahedron and the quintic equation:

6) Felix Klein, Lectures on the Icosahedron and the Solution of Equations
of the Fifth Degree, 1888.  Reprinted by Dover, New York, 2003.
Also available at <a href = "http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=03070001&seq=7">http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=03070001&seq=7</A>

Galois had already noticed that the number field you get by taking the 
rationals and throwing in the roots of a typical quintic:

$$
ax^{5} + bx^{4} + cx^{3} + dx^{2} + ex + f = 0
$$
    
has as its symmetry group all the permutations of the 5 roots.  Indeed,
he saw that the "unsolvability" of this group, in a technical 
sense, is
what makes it impossible to solve the quintic by radicals.  It must have 
been common knowledge that the symmetry group of the icosahedron is the 
group of all \emph{even} permutations of 5 things.  But, Klein took this much
further!  Alas, I've never really understood what he did.  Perhaps if
I read these and think hard, I'll understand:

7) Jerry Shurman, Geometry of the Quintic, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 
1997.

Acta Math. 163 (1989), 151-180.  Available at 
<A HREF = "http://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/icos/icos/icos.html">http://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/icos/icos/icos.html</A>

Anyway, it should be clear by now that Klein was a lover of symmetry.
He was also a bit of a visionary, and his obituary by Grace Chisholm 
Young shows that this got him in some trouble:

\begin{quote}
     One of Weierstrass' pupils, still alive, told me that at Berlin
     Klein was anathema: it was said that his work was not mathematics
     at all, but mere talk.  This criticism shows a want of appreciation
     of his rare type of mind.  It teemed with ideas and brilliant 
     reflections, but it is true that his work lacks the stern aspects 
     required by mathematical exactitude. It was in personal contact that 
     this was corrected, at least in so far as his students were concerned. 
     His favourite maxim was, &quot;Never be dull&quot;. 
\end{quote}
    

In a talk he wrote in 1872 when he was made professor at Erlangen 
University - a talk he didn't actually give! - Klein outlined what is now 
called his "Erlangen program".  The idea here is that different 
kinds of 
geometry correspond to different symmetry groups.  Taken to the extreme,
this philosophy says that a geometry is just a group!  In a given geometry, 
a "figure" of any kind - like a point or line - can be detected 
by the 
subgroup of symmetries that map that figure to itself.  So, a figure is 
just a subgroup!  

This program eventually led to a grand theory of groups and geometry based 
on "flag manifolds", which I tried to sketch in "<A HREF = "week178.html">week178</A>", "<A HREF = "week180.html">week180</A>", and 
"<A HREF = "week181.html">week181</A>".  

It's important to realize how similar the Erlangen program is to Galois 
theory.  Galois had also used group theory to classify how a little thing 
can sit in a bigger thing, but in situations where the "things" in question 
are commutative algebras - for example, the rational numbers with some roots 
of polynomials thrown in.

Now, commutative algebra is like topology, only backwards.  Any space has 
a commutative algebra consisting of functions on it, and if we're very 
clever we can think of any commutative algebra as functions on some space - 
though this was only achieved long after Galois, by Alexander Grothendieck. 

What do I mean by "backwards"?  Well, suppose you 
have a "covering
space" - a big space sitting over a little one, like a spiral sitting 
over the circle.  In this situation, any function on the little space 
downstairs defines a function on the big one upstairs.  So, the algebra 
of functions on the little space sits inside the algebra of functions on 
the big space.  

Notice how it's backwards.  Classifying how a little commutative
algebra can sit in a big one amounts to classifying how a big space 
can cover a little one!  For more details on this analogy, 
try "<A HREF = "week198.html">week198</A>", 
"<A HREF = "week201.html">week201</A>" and
especially "<A HREF = "week205.html">week205</A>". 
 
I should warn you: the Galois group has a different name when we apply 
it to the classification of covering spaces - we call it the group 
of "deck transformations".  The idea is pretty simple.  Suppose Y is a 
covering space of X, like this:

\begin{verbatim}
                            ----------------   
                            ----------------   Y 
                                               
                                               &darr; p
                                               
                            ----------------   X
\end{verbatim}
    
We've got a function p: Y \to  X, and sitting over each point of X are 
the same number of points of Y, living on different "sheets" that look
locally just like X.   You should imagine the sheets being able to 
twist around from place to place, like the edges of a Moebius strip.

Anyway, a "deck transformation" is just a way of mapping Y to itself 
that permutes the different points sitting over each point of X.  

The theory of this was worked out by Riemann, Poincare, and others.  
Poincare showed you could use this idea to turn any connected space X 
into a group - its "fundamental group".  There are different ways to
define this, but one is to form the most complicated possible 
covering space of X that's still connected - its "universal cover".
Then, take the group of deck transformations of this!  Following 
Galois' philosophy, all the other connected covering spaces of X 
correspond to subgroups of this group.  

The theory of the fundamental group was just the beginning when 
it came to groups and topology.  One of many later big steps, back 
in the late 1940s, was due to Sammy Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane.  
They saw how to reverse the "fundamental group" idea and turn any 
group back into a space!   

More precisely: for any group G, there's a space whose fundamental group
is G and whose higher homotopy groups vanish.  It's sometimes called the 
"Eilenberg - Mac Lane space" and denoted K(G,1), but sometimes it's called
the "classifying space" and denoted BG.  It's pretty easy to build; 
I described how back in "<A HREF = "week70.html">week70</A>".  

You start with a point:

\begin{verbatim}
                             o
\end{verbatim}
    
Then you stick on an edge looping from this point to itself for
each element a in G.   Unrolled, it looks like this: 

$$
                         o--a->--o
$$
    
where a is an element of our group.  Then, whenever we have ab = c in 
our group, we stick on a triangle like this:

\begin{verbatim}
                             o
                            / \
                           a   b
                          /     \
                         o---c---o
\end{verbatim}
    
Then, whenever we have abc = d in our group, we stick on a tetrahedron 
like this:

\begin{verbatim}
                             o                      
                            /|\                    
                           / | \                  
                          /  b  \                
                         a   |   bc             
                        /   _o_   \  
                       /   /   \_  \          
                      / _ab      c_ \        
                     /_/           \_\      
                    o--------d--------o
\end{verbatim}
    

And so on, forever!  For each list of n group elements, we get an
n-dimensional simplex in our Eilenberg-Mac Lane space.  The resulting
space knows everything about the group we started with.  In particular, 
the fundamental group of this space will be the group we started with!

Using this idea, we can do some fiendish things.  For example, for each n 
we can form a set C_{n}(G,A) consisting of all functions that eat 
n-dimensional simplices in the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space of G and spit 
out elements of some abelian group A.  There are maps

d: C_{n}(G,A) \to  C_{n+1}(G,A)
</P>
reflecting the fact that each (n+1)-simplex has a bunch of n-simplices
as its faces.  Since the boundary of a boundary is zero, 

d^{2} = 0
Guys who live in the kernel of 

d: C_{n}(G,A) \to  C_{n+1}(G,A)

are called "n-cocycles", and guys who live in the image of

d: C_{n-1}(G,A) \to  C_{n}(G,A)

are called "n-coboundaries".   Since d^{2} 
= 0, every coboundary is
a cocycle, but not always vice versa.  So, we can form the group of
cocycles mod coboundaries.  This is called the "nth cohomology
group" of G with coefficients in A, and it's denoted

H^{n}(G,A)
This sounds unmotivated at first, but the nth cohomology group of a
space is really just a clever way of keeping track of n-dimensional 
holes in that space.  So, what we're doing here is cleverly defining
a way to study "holes" in a \emph{group!}  
There are deeper, more conceptual
ways of understanding group cohomology, but this is not bad for starters.

For example, let's take the simplest group that's not \emph{utterly} dull -
the integers mod 2, or Z/2.  Here we get 

K(Z/2,1) = RP^{\infty }
where RP^{\infty } 
is the space formed by taking an infinite-dimensional
sphere and identifying opposite points.  This space has holes of 
arbitrarily high dimension, so the cohomology groups of Z/2 go on being 
nontrivial for arbitrarily high n.  I sketched a "picture proof" here:

8) John Baez, Fall 2004 Quantum Gravity Seminar, week 10, notes
by Derek Wise, <A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2004/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2004/</A>

and I showed that, for example

$$
            Z   if n = 0
H^{n}(Z/2,Z) = 0   if n is odd
            Z/2 if n is even and > 0
$$
    
I also explained how this stuff is related to topological quantum field
theory.

Anyway, all this is just the very superficial beginnings of the subject
of group cohomology.  Read Brown's book to dig deeper!

Personally, what I find most exciting about this book now are the
remarks on the "Euler characteristic" of a group.  Let me 
explain this...
though now I'll have to pull out the stops and assume you know some
group cohomology.

We can try to define the "Euler characteristic" of a group G to be the 
Euler characteristic of K(G,1).  This is the alternating sum of the 
dimensions of the rational cohomology groups

$$
H^{n}(G,Q)
$$
    

Of course, this alternating sum only converges if the cohomology
groups vanish for big enough n.  Also, they all need to be 
finite-dimensional.

Unfortunately, not many groups have well-defined Euler characteristic
with this naive definition!  

For example, people have studied groups G whose nth cohomology vanishes
for n > d, regardless of the coefficients.  If we take the smallest
d for which this holds, such a group G is said to have "cohomological 
dimension" d.  Eilenberg and Ganea showed that for d \ge  3, a group has 
cohomological dimension d whenever we can build K(G,1) as a simplicial 
complex (or CW complex) with no cells of dimension more than d.   

This is a nice geometrical interpretation of the cohomological dimension.  
But, one can show that groups with torsion never have finite cohomological
dimension!  We've seen an example already: Z/2, whose Eilenberg-Mac Lane
space is infinite-dimensional.

However, it turns out that there's a generalization of the Euler 
characteristic that makes sense for any group G that has a torsion-free 
subgroup H whose Euler characteristic is well-defined in the naive way, 
as long as H has finite index in G.  We just define the Euler characteristic
of G to be the Euler characteristic of H divided by the index of H in G.
The answer doesn't depend on the choice of H!

Take my favorite example, SL(2,Z).  This has torsion, so its cohomological
dimension is infinite and its naive Euler characteristic is undefined!  
Indeed, I wrote a whole issue of This Week's Finds about some elements of 
orders 4 and 6 sitting inside SL(2,Z), related to the symmetries of square 
and hexagonal lattices - see "<A HREF = "week125.html">week125</A>".   

But, SL(2,Z) has a torsion-free subgroup of index 12, namely its
commutator subgroup - the group you need to quotient by to make SL(2,Z)
be abelian.  This subgroup has finite cohomological dimension and its
Euler characteristic is -1.  I'm not sure why this is true, but Brown says
so!  This means the Euler characteristic of SL(2,Z) works out to be -1/12.  

If you've read my stuff about Euler characteristics in "<A HREF = "week147.html">week147</A>", you'll
see why this gets me so excited - I can add this stuff to my list of
weird ways of calculating the Euler characteristic.  Plus, it's related 
to the magical role of the number "24" in string theory, and also the 
Riemann zeta function!

Indeed, the Riemann zeta function gives a way to make rigorous Euler's
zany observation that

\begin{verbatim}
1 + 2 + 3 + .... = -1/12,
\end{verbatim}
    
as I explained here:

9) John Baez, Euler's Proof that 1+2+3+ ... = -1/12, Bernoulli
Numbers and the Riemann Zeta Function, Winter 2004 Quantum Gravity 
Seminar, homework for weeks 5,6,7, available at 
<A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2004/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2004/</A>

This suggests that there should be a version of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane
space for SL(2,Z) which has 1 cell of dimension 0, 2 cells of dimension
2, 3 cells of dimension 4, and so on.  Does anyone know if this is true?

More generally, G. Harder computed the (generalized) Euler characteristic
for a large class of arithmetic groups:

10) G. Harder, A Gauss-Bonnet formula for discrete arithmetically defined
groups, Ann. Sci. Ecole Norm. Sup. 4 (1971), 409-455.

For example, he looked at the symplectic group defined over the
integers, Sp(n,Z), and showed that its Euler characteristic is
this product of values of the Riemann zeta function:

&zeta;(-1) &zeta;(-3) &sdot;&sdot;&sdot; &zeta;(1-2n)

In the case n = 1 we get back SL(2,Z) and &zeta;(-1) = -1/12.

In fact, every Chevalley group over the integers has a well-defined
Euler characteristic, and Harder was able to compute it
in terms of Bernoulli numbers.  A Chevalley group is
sort of like a simple Lie group, but defined algebraically.  
Sp(n,Z) is one example.   SL(n,Z) is another, but it's Euler characteristic
turns out to vanish for n > 2, so it's not too interesting.  

Harder worked them all out.  For example, he showed
the Euler characteristic of the integral form of the exceptional group 
E_{7}
is some wacky number like

      - 691 \times  43867 &nbsp; / &nbsp; 2^{21} \times  3^{9} \times  5^{2} \times  7^{3} \times  11 \times  13 \times  19
Serre went even further, computing Euler characteristics of Chevalley
groups defined over algebraic number fields.  He also noticed that when
you write the Euler characteristic of a group as a fraction, the primes
in the denominator are precisely the primes p for which the group has
p-torsion.  He was thus able to conclude, for example, that 
E_{7} defined
over the integers has p-torsion for p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 19.

For more, see:

11) Jean-Pierre Serre, Cohomologie des groups discretes, Ann. Math.
Studies 70 (1971), 77-169.

This only takes us up to 1971.  I shudder to think what bizarre 
results along these lines are known by now!  Probably they'd seem not
bizarre but beautiful if I understood this stuff better: I don't really
have a clue how the Riemann zeta function gets into this game, so 
everything after that seems like black magic to me - bewitching but
bewildering.

But, it's clear that the study of groups and symmetry has not lost its
ability to turn up surprises.

\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
Addenda: I had often wondered how Klein's name got attached to the
pathetic little "4-group" mentioned above, which is just Z/2 x Z/2.
John McKay proffered an explanation:

\begin{quote}
 There is a group called the Klein group.
 It is denoted V<sub>4</sub> = The Vierer-Gruppe  (The fours group).

 Klein worked with the simple group of order 168 and found
 the "Klein quadric" which has it for symmetry group.

 The suggestion is that friends decided to call the non-cyclic 
 abelian group of order 4 the "Klein group" = the "little group"
 as a joke.

 I have a question you may like to posit to your readers:

 Is V<sub>4</sub> the abstract group or a permutation group?
 
 There are other points ... I presume you know that your
 -1/12 is &zeta;(-1). There is a paper by Lepowsky on the occurrence
 of such &zeta;(-n) involving vertex algebras.

 I dearly wish I understood cohomology!
 I am busy tethering moonshine!
 Best,
 John
\end{quote}
    

This group of order 168 has made an appearance here before, in "<A HREF
= "week194.html">week194</A>": it's PSL(3,Z/2) - the group of
symmetries of the projective plane over Z/2, or "Fano plane", whose
points can also be thought of as imaginary unit octonions.  It's also
PSL(2,Z/7).  I've long been mystified by its relation to Klein's
quartic, mainly because I've never spent time trying to understand it!
- it's just one of those things that's been gnawing at the edges of my
consciousness, especially ever since I saw this book come out:

12) Silvio Levy, The Eightfold Way: the Beauty of Klein's Quartic Curve,
MSRI Research Publications 35, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge 1999.
Available at <A HREF = "http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book35/">http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book35/</A>

It has a translation of Klein's original paper on this subject.
Someday I'll break down and study this.

Anyway....

James Dolan mentioned some other folklore saying that the "Kleinian 
groups" were \emph{also} named after Klein as a joke:
\begin{quote}
 by the way, i enjoyed the latest twf a lot (although i don't know why
 we seem to never get a chance to talk about all this stuff ourselves
 that much), but i noticed that you (apparently non-ironically)
 mentioned kleinian groups as a famous thing named after klein, without
 telling the story that i always hear about how poincare gave kleinian
 groups the name &quot;kleinian groups&quot; after klein complained to poincare
 about poincare's use of the terminology &quot;fuchsian groups&quot; for
 something that fuchs apparently didn't event.
 
 i guess that the versions of the story that i'd heard seemed to
 suggest that klein was complaining because he thought that fuchs
 hadn't significantly contributed to the study of fuchsian groups, and
 that poincare may have been naively trying to placate klein and/or
 not-so-naively twitting him by then giving the name &quot;kleinian groups&quot;
 to something that klein hadn't significantly contributed to the study
 of.

 however i did just look for the story on the web, and the tellings
 that i found there i guess don't really suggest that klein didn't
 &quot;significantly contribute to the study of&quot; kleinian groups (or at
 least not by my standards).  it's still not clear though what sort of
 reaction poincare may have been trying to provoke in klein, and
 whether he succeeded in provoking it.  it's claimed that poincare did
 come up with the name &quot;kleinian function&quot; later in the same day after
 klein complained about the name &quot;fuchsian function&quot;, and also that
 klein was subsequently just as vociferous in complaining to poincare
 about the name &quot;kleinian function&quot; as he was in complaining about the
 name &quot;fuchsian function&quot;.  but apparently klein's complaints were
 based on _very_ exacting concerns about absolute priority, so that the
 names &quot;fuchsian function&quot; and &quot;kleinian function&quot; 
 can be seen as
 inappropriate only by the standards of someone with similarly
 ridiculous concerns about absolute priority, rather than by a
 reasonable person such as myself.

 i'd also heard that klein's nervous breakdown was provoked by the
 stress of trying to keep up with a genius like poincare, but maybe it
 was actually provoked by poincare's apparently casual attitude towards
 priority disputes and/or concept-naming.

 i'd thought of asking you about this issue of whether klein really did
 have much to do with kleinian groups right after i read the advance
 copy of twf that you sent me, but i guess that i didn't notice that it
 was an advance copy.  i guess that it doesn't matter though, since
 apparently there _is_ a case to be made that klein had lots to do with
 developing the theory of kleinian groups; just not by his own
 apparently ridiculous standards.

Noam Elkies suggested that the commutator subgroup of SL(2,Z)
has Euler characteristic -1 because it's a a free group on 2
generators, so its classifying space is a figure 8, with Euler
characteristic 1 - 2 = -1 since it has one vertex and two edges.

This sounds right.  In particular, I already mentioned how Brown
claims the commutator subgroup of SL(2,Z) is torsion-free.  Further,
Kevin Buzzard shows below that any torsion-free subgroup of SL(2,Z)
is a free group.  So, we just need to check that the commutator
subgroup of SL(2,Z) can be generated by two elements but not by just one.

Laurent Bartholdi just made this job easier;
he sent me an email saying these are free generators
for the commutator subgroup of SL(2,Z):

\begin{verbatim}
( 2 -1)
(-1  1)
\end{verbatim}
    

and

\begin{verbatim}
( 1 -1)
(-1  2)
\end{verbatim}
    

In fact, Kevin Buzzard's email was packed with wisdom.  He wrote:
