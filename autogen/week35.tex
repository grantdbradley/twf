1) Pursuing stacks (A la poursuite des champs), 1983 letter from Alexandre
Grothendieck to Daniel Quillen, 593 pages.  Scanned version available
from the Grothendieck Circle at <A HREF = "http://www.grothendieckcircle.org/">http://www.grothendieckcircle.org/</A>

I owe somebody enormous thanks for sending this to me, but I won't
mention his name, since I don't want people pestering him for copies.
(This no longer matters, now that it's available online.)
Grothendieck is mainly famous for his work on algebraic geometry, in
which he introduced the concept of "schemes" to provide a modern
framework for the subject.  He was also interested in reformulating the
foundations of topology, which is reflected in "Pursuing Stacks".  
This
is a long letter to Quillen, inspired by Quillen's 1967 book
"Homotopical Algebra".  It's a fascinating mixture of visionary
mathematics, general philosophy and a bit of personal chat.  Let me
quote a bit:
